# Data-Cleaning-in-SQL

This Project is basically done to understand how the data cleaning is done with SQL.

I have used SQL SERVER tool.

The dataset is taken from the AlexTheAnalyst github page for the project purpose. Datasetâ€™s location at the github is mentioned below:

Dataset name-- Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning

Data Cleaning is a super underrated skill in the Data Analyst community. so I hope this can be helpful to start you on your journey to learning the skill.

Breaking out Address into Individual Columns (Address, City, State) and updating the columns
Change Y and N to Yes and No in "Sold as Vacant" field and updating the column name
Removing Duplicates using ROW_NUMBER window function and deleting the duplicates with cte method and
finally making the copy of the Table and then deleting the unused columns from the Table.
